This is a simple game I made using Scratch for my first semester programming project.

A diver will catch fishes.

For navigation, use left-right, up-down arrows.

->If the diver touches any of the three types of fishes, he will get: 1,3,5 points.
->If he touches crab he will lose 1 point and if he touches octopus he will lose 3 points.
->if he touches a shark, he'll lose one life (three lives will be given at the beginning).
->Then if he scores 100 points, he will win the game.

The game can be played on scratch website: https://scratch.mit.edu/
